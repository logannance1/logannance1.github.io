    Hey my name is Logan Nance and this is my JavaScript Portfolio.
    The projects on this website consist of code and designs made
    during my Web 1430 class here at Weber State University.
    I have been programming since I was 15 when I wanted to make
    a Minecraft mod in Java. I never actually made what I intended
    but what I learned was that I loved coding. Everything about
    getting a computer to do things for you, combined with my
    love for Mathematics and Logic, made me want to pursue a career
    in this field. My favorite language is actually C++ but I also
    like Python and SQL believe it or not.

      make them.
